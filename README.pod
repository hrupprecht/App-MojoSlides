=head1 NAME

App::MojoSlides - Write your presentations in Perl and Mojolicious!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $ mojo_slides mypresentation.pl daemon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This application lets you write presentations using the simple Perlish syntax that
L<Mojo::Template> provides for L<Mojolicious>. It follows a similar model to LaTeX Beamer
in structure and usage, though it is not nearly as full featured.

=head1 WARNING

This software is in alpha form at best. It may eat baby kittens at any moment.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 The Presentation File

Each presentation needs a configuration file.
This file is loaded by the C<mojo_slides> application via L<Mojolicious::Plugin::Config>,
and as such may use any functionality it provides.
Additionally, when the file is loaded one helper C<presentation_file> will have been added
which can be used to reference the file and its path (see more below).

=head3 Configuration Keys

The file must evaluate to a hash reference, as all Mojolicious config files must.
The application will look for several keys which establish the presentation.

=over

=item slides

A hash reference used to create the L<App::MojoSlides::Slides> object which organizes the slide order, etc.
See that module for documentation on how to use it.

=item ppi

If true, it will load L<Mojolicious::Plugin::PPI> to allow code highlighting using that plugin.
The API for this key is still influx, but that much is probably not going to change.

=item templates

Use this key to specify which directories contain your slides.
Your slides are actually Mojolicious Templates (see L<Mojolicious::Guides::Rendering> and L<Mojo::Template> for more on that.
This key take a string or arrayref of strings which are prepended to the app's template directories.

=item static

Like C<templates> this, key takes a string or arrayref of strings, which are directories prepended to the app's static files directories.
Use this to allow the inclusion of other style files or javascript that you might need.
Of course you will still have to include them in some template for them to be included.

=item bootstrap_theme

If true, the bootstrap-theme.min.css file will be included in the default layout.

=head1 DEDICATION

This module is dedicated to the organizers and attendees of YAPC::Brazil 2013.
They were kind enough to invite me as their keynote speaker and in turn I wrote this application to present that talk, so I owe them a debt of thanks on both accounts.
